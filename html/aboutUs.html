                <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Studs started off as a motorcycle gang in 2002. As the years went by, members of Studs started realizing they wanted to actually pursue higher education, who then dropped out of the gang to attend college. Fights ensued over the next year, and the only remaining survivors were the ones who were in college - majoring in martial arts. Their names were Helia, Claire, and Rainbow, who together made the founding organization, Can Hoes Ride (this di-) AKA CHR. Under CHR, The studying website, Studs., was created. Studs. was created by the founding members of CHR in hopes that motorcycle gang members drop out and successfully pursue a higher education, just like them.
